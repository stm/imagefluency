## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* updated roxygen2 to use HTML5 for documentation pages
* added a new vignette on analyzing multiple images at once
* fixed a minor error (alpha channel throwing error with typicality)

## Test environments
* local macOS 11.6 install, R 4.1.0
via gh-actions: macOS, windows, ubuntu (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

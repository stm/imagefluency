\usage{
img_self_similarity(img, full = FALSE, logplot = FALSE, raw = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{An image in form of a matrix or array of numeric values,
preferably by square size. If the input is not square, bilinear resizing to
a square size is performade using the
\code{\link[OpenImageR:resizeImage]{OpenImageR}} package. Use e.g.
\code{\link{img_read}()} to read an image file into \code{R}.}

\item{full}{logical. Should the full frequency range be used for
interpolation? (default: \code{FALSE})}

\item{logplot}{logical. Should the log-log power spectrum of the image be
plotted? (default: \code{FALSE})}

\item{raw}{logical. Should the raw value of the regression slope be returned?
(default: \code{FALSE})}
}
\value{
a numeric value (self-similarity)
}
\description{
\code{img_self_similarity} returns the self-similarity of an image (i.e., the
degree to which the log-log power spectrum of the image falls with a slope of
-2). Higher values indicate higher image self-similarity.
}
\details{
The function takes a (square) array or matrix of numeric or integer
  values representing an image as input and returns the self-similarity of
  the image. Self-similarity is computed via the slope of the log-log power
  spectrum using OLS. A slope near \code{-2} indicates fractal-like
  properties (see Redies et al., 2007; Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001). Thus,
  value for self-similarity that is return by the function calculated as
  \code{self-similarity = abs(slope + 2) * (-1)}. That is, the measure
  reaches its maximum value of 0 for a slope of -2, and any deviation from -2
  results in negative values that are more negative the higher the deviation
  from -2. For color images, the weighted average between each color channel's
  values is computed (cf. Mayer & Landwehr 2018).

  Per default, only the frequency range betwen 10 and 256 cycles per image is
  used for interpolation. Computation for the full range can be set via the
  parameter \code{full = TRUE}.

  If \code{logplot} is set to \code{TRUE} then a log-log plot of the power
  spectrum is additionally shown. If the package \code{ggplot2} is installed
  the plot includes the slope of the OLS regression. Note that this option is
  currently implemented for grayscale images.

  It is possible to get the raw regression slope (instead of the transformed
  value which indicates self-similarity) by using the option \code{raw =
  TRUE}.

  For color images, the weighed average between each color channel's values
  is computed.

\usage{
img_complexity(imgfile, algorithm = "zip", rotate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{imgfile}{Either a character string containing the path to the image
file (or URL) or an an image in form of a matrix (grayscale image) or array
(color image) of numeric values representing the pre-loaded image (e.g. by
using \code{\link{img_read}()}).}

\item{algorithm}{Character string that specifies which image compression
algorithm to use. Currently implemented are \code{zip} with deflate
compression (default), \code{jpg}, \code{gif}, and \code{png}.}

\item{rotate}{logical. Should the compressed file size of the rotated image
also be computed? (see details)}
}
\value{
a numeric value: the ratio of the compressed divided by the
  uncompressed image file size
}
\description{
\code{img_complexity} returns the complexity of an image via image
compression. Higher values indicate higher image complexity.
}
\details{
The function returns the visual complexity of an image. Visual
  complexity is calculated as ratio between the compressed and uncompressed
  image file size. Preferably, the original image is an uncompressed image
  file.

  The function takes the file path of an image file (or URL) or a pre-loaded
  image as input argument (\code{imgfile}) and returns the ratio of the
  compressed divided by the uncompressed image file size. Values can range
  between almost 0 (virtually completely compressed image, thus extremly
  simple image) and 1 (no compression possible, thus extremely complex
  image).

  You can choose between different image compression algorithms. Currently
  implemented are \code{zip} with deflate compression (default), \code{jpg},
  \code{gif}, and \code{png}. See Mayer & Landwehr (2018) for a discussion of
  different image compression algorithms for measuring visual complexity.

  As most compression algorithms do not depict horizontal and vertical
  redundancies equally, the function includes an optional \code{rotate}
  parameter (default: \code{FALSE}). Setting this parameter to \code{TRUE}
  has the following effects: first, the image is rotated by 90 degrees.
  Second, the rotated image is written in the working directory and a
  compressed version is created. Finally, the overall compressed image's file
  size is computed as the minimum of the original image's file size and the
  file size of the rotated image. All files that are created while the
  function runs are automatically deleted once the complexity score is
  calculated.

  As \code{R}'s built-in \code{bmp} device creates (a) indexed instead of
  True Color images and (b) creates files with different file sizes depending
  on the operating system, the function relies on the \code{magick} package
  to write (and read) images. Thus, for the current version, permission to
  read and write files in the specified directory path / working directory is
  needed for this function to work properly.

# Example image with high complexity: trees
trees <- img_read(system.file("example_images", "trees.jpg", package = "imagefluency"))
# display image
grid::grid.raster(trees)
# get complexity

# Example image with low complexity: sky
sky <- img_read(system.file("example_images", "sky.jpg", package = "imagefluency"))
# display image
grid::grid.raster(sky)
# get complexity
img_complexity(sky)
